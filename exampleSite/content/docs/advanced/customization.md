Hextra offers some default customization options in the `hugo.yaml` config file to configure the theme.
This page describes the available options and how to customize the theme further.

## Custom CSS

To add custom CSS, we need to create a file `assets/css/custom.css` in our site. Hextra will automatically load this file.

### Font Family

The font family of the content can be customized using:

```css {filename="assets/css/custom.css"}
.content {
  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}
```

### Inline Code Element

The color of text mixed with `other text` can customized with:

```css {filename="assets/css/custom.css"}
.content code:not(.code-block code) {
  color: #c97c2e;
}
```

### Primary Color

The primary color of the theme can be customized by setting the `--primary-hue` and `--primary-saturation` variables:

```css {filename="assets/css/custom.css"}
:root {
  --primary-hue: 100deg;
  --primary-saturation: 90%;
}
```

### Syntax Highlighting

List of available syntax highlighting themes are available at [Chroma Styles Gallery](https://xyproto.github.io/splash/docs/all.html). The stylesheet can be generated using the command:

```shell
hugo gen chromastyles --style=github
```

To override the default syntax highlighting theme, we can add the generated styles to the custom CSS file.

## Custom Scripts

You may add custom scripts to the end of the head for every page by adding the following file:

```
layouts/partials/custom/head-end.html
```

## Custom Layouts

The layouts of the theme can be overridden by creating a file with the same name in the `layouts` directory of your site.
For example, to override the `single.html` layout for docs, create a file `layouts/docs/single.html` in your site.

For further information, refer to the [Hugo Templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/).
