## Upgrade Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking Changes**: This release includes several breaking changes. Please review the checklist and [Migration Guide](#migration-guide) before upgrading.

Before upgrading to v0.10.0, ensure you have:

- Hugo v0.146.0+ (extended version) installed
- Reviewed custom CSS for class name changes (see [CSS Class Prefix Changes](#css-class-prefix-changes) and [Tailwind CSS v4](#tailwind-css-v4))
- Ensured build environment has internet access for asset downloads

Once ready, update the Hugo module:

```bash
hugo mod get -u github.com/imfing/hextra@v0.10.0
```

## New Features

### Dropdown Menu Support in Navbar

Create dropdown menus in your navigation bar for better navigation items organization.

```yaml {filename="hugo.yaml"}
menu:
  main:
    - identifier: products
      name: "Products"
    - name: "Product A"
      parent: products
      url: "/product-a"
    - name: "Product B"
      parent: products
      url: "/product-b"
```

### Enhanced Search Experience

- **Search in all headings**: Find content across all heading levels, not just page titles
- **Improved result accuracy**: Better title handling and linking precision
- **Fixed result navigation**: Search results now link to the correct page sections

Kudos to [@ldez](https://github.com/ldez) for pushing the search capabilities forward!

### llms.txt Support

Hextra now supports [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) output format for your site, making your site more accessible to AI tools and language models for context and reference.

```yaml {filename="hugo.yaml"}
outputs:
  home: [html, llms]
```

This will generate an `llms.txt` file at your site's root.

### Table of Contents Scroll Highlighting

The table of contents now automatically highlights the current section as you scroll through the page, making navigation more intuitive.

### Synchronized Tab Switching

Tabs with the same items now synchronize across the page. When sync is enabled, selecting a tab updates all tab groups that share the same items list (and your selection is remembered).

```yaml {filename="hugo.yaml"}
params:
  page:
    tabs:
      sync: true
```

### Blog List Pagination

Basic pagination controls have been added to blog listing pages.

```yaml {filename="hugo.yaml"}
params:
  blog:
    list:
      pagerSize: 20 # Posts per page
```

### MathJax Support

Render mathematical expressions with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) alongside the default KaTeX support. Choose the engine that best fits your needs.

```yaml {filename="hugo.yaml"}
params:
  math:
    engine: "mathjax" # default is "katex"
```

## Migration Guide

### Breaking Changes

#### CSS Class Prefix Changes

**Impact**: Sites with custom CSS targeting Hextra component classes

Hextra v0.10.0 introduces consistent `hextra-` prefixing for majority of component CSS classes to improve maintainability and prevent conflicts with user styles.

**Action required**: If you have custom CSS targeting Hextra components, update the following class names:

| Area                 | Before                       | After                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Search (container)   | `.search-wrapper`            | `.hextra-search-wrapper`                          |
| Search (input)       | `.search-input`              | `.hextra-search-input`                            |
| Search (results)     | `.search-results`            | `.hextra-search-results`                          |
| Search (title)       | `.search-wrapper .title`     | `.hextra-search-wrapper .hextra-search-title`     |
| Search (active item) | `.search-wrapper .active`    | `.hextra-search-wrapper .hextra-search-active`    |
| Search (no result)   | `.search-wrapper .no-result` | `.hextra-search-wrapper .hextra-search-no-result` |
| Search (prefix)      | `.search-wrapper .prefix`    | `.hextra-search-wrapper .hextra-search-prefix`    |
| Search (excerpt)     | `.search-wrapper .excerpt`   | `.hextra-search-wrapper .hextra-search-excerpt`   |
| Search (match)       | `.search-wrapper .match`     | `.hextra-search-wrapper .hextra-search-match`     |
| Navbar blur          | `.nav-container-blur`        | `.hextra-nav-container-blur`                      |
| Hamburger menu       | `.hamburger-menu`            | `.hextra-hamburger-menu`                          |
| Theme toggle         | `.theme-toggle`              | `.hextra-theme-toggle`                            |
| Language switcher    | `.language-switcher`         | `.hextra-language-switcher`                       |
| Sidebar container    | `.sidebar-container`         | `.hextra-sidebar-container`                       |
| Sidebar active item  | `.sidebar-active-item`       | `.hextra-sidebar-active-item`                     |
| Code filename        | `.filename`                  | `.hextra-code-filename`                           |
| Copy icon            | `.copy-icon`                 | `.hextra-copy-icon`                               |
| Success icon         | `.success-icon`              | `.hextra-success-icon`                            |
| Steps                | `.steps`                     | `.hextra-steps`                                   |

**Migration steps:**

1. Search your custom CSS files for any of the "Before" class names
2. Replace them with the corresponding "After" class names
3. Test your site's styling after the update

#### Hugo Version Requirements

**Impact**: Sites running older Hugo versions

Hextra v0.10.0 requires Hugo v0.146.0 or later (extended version) due to the new template system adoption.

**Action required**: Update Hugo to v0.146.0+ before upgrading Hextra

#### Asset Management for KaTeX and Mermaid

**Impact**: Sites using KaTeX or Mermaid

Hextra v0.10.0 now downloads KaTeX and Mermaid assets from CDN during build time.

**What's changed:**

- Build process now requires internet access to download these assets
- No more external CDN calls for these assets after build

**Action required**:

- Ensure your build environment has internet access to download assets
- Sites in air-gapped environments may need to pre-download these assets and configure Hextra to load them

#### Tailwind CSS v4

**Impact**: Sites with extensive custom CSS targeting Hextra Tailwind classes `hx-*`

While Hextra handles the Tailwind CSS v4 migration internally, sites with heavy customizations may need further adjustments.

**What's changed:**

- Internal CSS compilation now uses Tailwind CSS v4.x
- Utility classes now prefix with `hx:` rather than `hx-`
