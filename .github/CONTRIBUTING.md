## Guidelines

### Contributing Code

To contribute, please follow the ["Fork and Pull Request"][fork and pull] workflowï¼š

Fork the repository, make your changes, and then submit a pull request.
Please make sure to include a description of the changes you made and why you made them.
Use [Conventional Commits][conventional commits] message to make it easier to understand the changes you made.

### Contributing Documentation

Similar to contributing code, you can also contribute to the documentation by submitting a pull request.

The documentation site is located in the [`exampleSite`](../exampleSite/) folder.
You can make changes to the documentation and create a pull request. A preview of the new documentation will be automatically generated and displayed in the pull request comment via [Netlify][netlify deploy preview].

### ðŸ’¬ GitHub Discussions

Weâ€™re using [Discussions][discussions] as a place to connect with other members using Hextra:

- Ask questions youâ€™re wondering about.
- Share ideas.
- Engage with other users.

### GitHub Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue][issues].

Please make sure to include a description of the bug or feature you are requesting. If you are reporting a bug, please include steps to reproduce the bug.

We recommend that you search existing [issues][issues] or discussions before opening a new one to prevent duplicates.

## Development

> **Note**
> You can start developing on [GitHub Codespaces][open in codespaces] or use [devcontainer][devcontainer] locally without installing any dependencies.

### Local development setup

- [Hugo][hugo] >= v0.124.0 (extended version)
- [Node.js][nodejs]
- [Go][go]

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

### Project structure

- [`assets`](../assets/): CSS styles and JavaScript files.
- [`data`](../data/): The theme data files. Now only contains the `icons.yaml` file.
- [`exampleSite`](../exampleSite/): The documentation site for the theme.
- [`i18n`](../i18n/): The theme translation files.
- [`layouts`](../layouts/): The theme layouts.
- [`static`](../static/): The static files for the theme. For example, the favicon and the site logo.

Please refer to the [Hugo documentation][hugo] for more information.

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev:theme
```

It will start the Hugo server on `http://localhost:1313/` for the `exampleSite` content.

### Compile the styles

For development preview, we compile the Tailwind CSS styles on the fly. But for production, we need to compile the styles first.

```bash
npm run build:css
```

It will compile the Tailwind CSS styles and generate the `assets/css/compiled/main.css` file.
